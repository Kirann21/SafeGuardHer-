# <u> `Problem Statement ` :mag: </u>
In a world where safety and security are paramount concerns, our mission is to harness the power of technology to ensure the safety and well-being of women, providing them with a reliable and accessible lifeline in times of distress.

Statistics and real-life experiences have highlighted the unfortunate reality of safety concerns faced by women in various situations. Whether walking alone at night, commuting in unfamiliar areas, or facing any threat, SafeGuardHer is here to offer support and peace of mind.

Our project introduces an innovative Emergency SOS feature designed exclusively for women. This feature empowers users to take control of their safety with a single touch, instantly alerting predefined contacts, authorities, or trusted friends when an emergency arises. It goes beyond a simple alert system, offering the option to share real-time location information with selected contacts, ensuring that help arrives swiftly and accurately.

By combining technology, empowerment, and community support, the Women Safety SOS Project aims to make the world a safer place for women. We invite you to explore this project, join our mission, and contribute to a future where every woman can live without fear!
